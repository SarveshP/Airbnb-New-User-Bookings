# Airbnb New User Bookings

How do we know which travel destination the new user books? How do you train a classifier and evaluate using a ranking metric to suggest the top 5 countries? Which countries have almost no Airbnb bookings? Do people prefer to travel long distances, do they accept different cultural languages? I answer these questions through this project.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the assests you will need the following:

* Python 3
